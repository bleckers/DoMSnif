This repo includes all files for the DoMSnif LCD Bluetooth adapter project - https://hackaday.io/project/166220-domsnif-dot-matrix-lcd-sniffer-bluetooth-adapter

## CSVDecoder
Decodes a logic analyser CSV file with KS0108 LCD data. Works directly with the Saleae Logic CSV output. Will need conversion from other formats. There is a demo file included in CSVDecoder/KS0108/bin/Release/lcd.7z
